# Fifa_Moneyball-Case-Study
Case Study using the Fifa-Moneyball dataset

This is a case study as part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp
The Fifa-Moneyball datafile is containing a lot of information about players, their demographics,
skills, ranking and their market value.

In this case study, I want to analyse which skills are the biggest drivers of the market value of a player.
In other words, if I am a football player, which skills I would need to focus on, to increase my market value.
Since the skills needed for certain positions in the game (e.g. forwards, midfielders, defenders and goalkeeper)
vary, the analysis would also need to be split by position.

Limitations on the analysis are, that not all data, that could influence the market value is available.
For instance there is no information about previous games/experience of the players.
