# Fifa_Moneyball-Case-Study
Case Study using the Fifa-Moneyball dataset

This is a case study as part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp
The Fifa-Moneyball datafile is containing a lot of information about players, their demographics,
skills, ranking and their market value.

In this case study, I want to analyse the influence of the nationality of a player on its market value.
My Hypothesis is, that players with similar skills/strength reach different market values, depending on their nationality.
It would be interesting to see, what are the favourite nationalities, respectively the players of what nationality have the highest market values.

Limitations on the analysis are, that not all data, that could influence the market value is available.
For instance there is no information about previous games/experience of the players.
